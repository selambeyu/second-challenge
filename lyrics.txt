[Verse 1]
Late night vibes, coffee getting cold
Stories in my mind waiting to be told
Rain against the window, soft and slow
Let the music take me where I need to go

[Chorus]
Drifting through the hours
Lost in mellow sounds
Finding peace in quiet moments
Where the calm is found

[Verse 2]
City lights are fading, stars come out to play
Another page is turning at the end of day
Headphones on, the world just slips away
In this lo-fi dream, I think I'll stay
